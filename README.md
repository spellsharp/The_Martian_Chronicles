# Project Report


## Day 1 (Got the task today):


Finished coding the functions

Finished designing some of the GUI

After doing this for a few hours, I can see patterns in the python code for the GUI

- use 'self' to work on the current instance of the class.

- make layouts to add widgets into it so they all can be enclosed together. 

--------------------------------------------
## Day 2:


Made some corrections to the code. I had misinterpreted the question before. 

Now the functions all run well. 'Automate The Boring Stuff With Python' really has helped
me with my coding.

After today, 
- I feel confident about my code. The GUI runs well as well. 

- I just have to set up the proper layout and make the design better.

- I have thought of some ideas that would be good for the app.

- I'm quite thrilled to have reached this far. I had no idea I would be making an actual desktop app

---------------------------------------------
## Day 3:


There isn't much for me to do. Just making minor changes. 

I created a different window for the 'Share' part of the task. 

- Now I'm a bit confident with handling classes. I'm also starting to realise how powerful classes are.

- I plan on using the Qt designer for making the ShareWindow better in design.

---------------------------------------------
## Day 4:


Turns out the Qt Designer's code is a lot harder to understand after getting used to hardcoding my main window. 

- I probably won't use Qt Designer for my main window since there are already too many functions in my main class.

---------------------------------------------
## Day 5:


Tried creating another window for getting parameters from user like with ShareWindow.

But there is a problem with the way I use the class instance variable(that's what its called if I recall)

I have decided to forget about creating another class for Fetch. It must be a minor mistake and I've spent an entire day on it. I don't have much time. Turns out someone has almost finished it. I don't want to lag behind.

- After using the Qt Designer and trying to understand it, I found out that you can create a big layout in which you can place smaller layouts and in those smaller layouts you could add for example a QLabel and a QLineEdit or another widget together for better alignment.

- With this understanding, I worked on the Qt Designer for my Share Window. Finished it. It is better than when I hardcoded it but it feels like the things are just better aligned.

- I finished the designing for getting Fetch parameters from user as well. 

- I made it so that the textboxes and other input widgets appear only after the fetch button is created instead of just leaving it on the Main Window from the start.

- I did the same for the 'Share' button as well.


----------------------------------------------
## Day 6:

- I suppose today is the last day before submission. I don't have much left.

- I decided to display images one by one by using 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons. I could also set up a scroll feature but this seems faster and gets the job done.

- Finished implementing it.

- I was planning on setting up a mini calender widget for choosing the earth date but it seemed like just a fancy feature to me. It would also take time for the user to select and click the day, month and year. I feel its better if I just let the user type the date in the required format on their keyboard.


----------------------------------------------
## Day 7:
Done with the project. Hopefully there isn't anything I missed.

I learnt a lot while working on this project. Interacting with one of my friends was quite interesting as well. He told me he was implementing 'threading' and I got curious about it. So I naturally googled and got an idea of what it was. I recall threading was introduced in the ATBSWP book but its practical use was not really made clear.

-----------------------------------------------
Thank you for giving us this project and the opportunity to work on it.
